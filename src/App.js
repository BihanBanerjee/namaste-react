/*
 * proper valid syntax in jsx. jsxHeading is a valid React element. We don't
 * need to create react element like we did before(very tedious and not developer-friendly.) So, this is how we create react
 * element using jsx. The above line is not pure JS. JS engine doesnt understand this h1 tag. This is not proper JavaScript.
 * but how things are going right then? how we can I see the page rendered? The parcel package under the hood is doing this.
 * The jsx code is transpiled before it reaches to JS engine(transpiled to code that is understandable by the browser)
 * by parcel. but the question is does parcel transpile the code on its own? No, Parcel acts as a manager. it basically gives
 * the responsibility of transpilation to another package called babel. now, the question arises I never installed babel, but
 * it was automatically installed by parcel as its dependency package.
 * jsx---> babel ---> code understandable by the browser/JS engine/ React.
 * Babel is not created by Meta/Facebook.
